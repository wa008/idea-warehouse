All it did was erase all of my progress.\n\nI deleted it again  and won\u2019t download again unless changes happen. They should sell this app to someone who will fix these issues",

During this time, I heard about this app but always managed fine in the various places I lived and traveled (international and domestic). \n\nI finally ended up paying for the app about 2 months ago when I found myself in a village in Basque country where there was rarely vegetarian food on menus and a number of restaurants that did have more veg options were closed. No options were listed on HappyCow. Walking around, I eventually found a restaurant that offered a salad that could be made vegetarian or vegan and it was delicious. I took the time to submit this restaurant and meal to HappyCow, as I was very thankful to have found it and wished it had been something I\u2019d found when checking the app. My submission was rejected because the restaurant serves primarily non-vegetarian food, which was disappointing. \n\nI continued to try to use the app in France and Spain over the next several weeks. HappyCow never once helped me find a vegetarian or vegan place to eat. There were either 1\u20132 listings with one or two bad reviews or there were simply no listings. \n\nI felt like I was using an app that had been abandoned. It was a ghost town. \n\nI\u2019ll keep using Yelp and Google to find vegetarian/vegan food \u2014 I\u2019ve had much more luck with these free tools.\n\nEdit in response to developer response: I appreciate that this is a small team; however, the app was a disappointment for me, a vegan, and my personal experience is that Yelp and Google are more accurate and up to date.",

Haven\u2019t tried non battery saving mode so that might help, but if you want to sit down and bang out a few games in 30 minutes, this isn\u2019t your game.\n\nUpdate: Battery save mode off didn\u2019t appreciably speed up the game. But it caused the battery drop from 73% to 45% in a single game. I\u2019ll be holding off on the DLC until they address these issues. There was previously a better version of this game that they removed in favor of one with micro-transactions. Too bad, that version was amazing, and still had the other expansions available to buy. I don\u2019t know if it was the same company or not, but a clear example of removing a successful version and replacing it with a marginally functional one with higher revenue potential.",

The mobile game is very outdated and seems to be like one of the older files. I would really like to see this game be updated to a more recent file because unlike the computer game you can\u2019t customize your own character and the graphics are very underwhelming.

It\u2019s missing history of Susanna, Bel Of The dragon and the Prayer of Mannesah.\n2. Unlike other Bible apps, it does not sink across your different devices. He wants you to pay a fee for each device like your desktop, iPad and iPhone. Why not charge one flat fee and they sync across all devices? \n3. And this last one could be just a personal preference. Why do I have to hold down the scripture every time to add adjustments to a note already established. I should be able to click on that note one time to add or delete commentary or precepts.\n\nLastly, I want to say that I don\u2019t have a problem paying for this app and it services. It has potential. But the fact that I\u2019m paying for a app that\u2019s incomplete in my opinion because it\u2019s missing books is unfair.

But that\u2019s just what this game and many other Flipline games do. You quit playing their game and it opens the App Store to one of their other games. \n\nPlease update your games and stop this from happening. I have purchased pretty much every one of your titles and I even spend money in them outside of the initial purchase price. But, it\u2019s become very annoying that every time I\u2019m done playing one of them. That the App Store opens without my permission. That just seems like malware activity if I\u2019m honest. \n\nAgain, please would you update your games and stop them from doing this annoying behavior?\n\nOutside of this problem I really enjoy so many of the Papa Louie\u2019s video games a lot. I\u2019ve played quite a few of them to completion. I definitely would recommend their titles but I just wish they would get rid of this annoying tactic please. Thank you.",

However I found this game to be quite difficult from the very beginning and all the maps are locked behind either beating the previous level on a certain difficulty or a paywall.  I know people will say \u2018get good\u2019, but the game also doesn\u2019t do a good job of giving you hints on how to improve and all the bonus items are again locked behind a paywall so you can\u2019t even grind for them.  This game is a big disappointment due to the learning curve.  And if I don\u2019t want to pay for the zombies or vampires, you have to beat all the levels on the hard mode.  I cannot recommend this to anyone but the most die hard fan of this game.  I hope the develop has improved on their other titles.\n\nUpdate:  I beat all the main game plagues on Brutal difficulty and the game only allowed me to play the shadow/vampire plague once and then locked me out to buy even though it said it would open up if I beat the main plagues on that difficulty level. What is the deal.  I know people like this game but it seems like it it always blocking me from trying the next thing.",

I submitted a message to support team via ninja kiwi\u2019s website several weeks ago to make them aware if they weren\u2019t already. Before I did that, I had given it plenty of time to resolve after making absolutely sure the softwares for both the game and my iPhone were up-to-date. It\u2019s been a few weeks since submitting that message, and it is STILL crashing. I\u2019ve been trying to get black borders on maps, and in EVERY CHIMPS ATTEMPT I DO ON ANY MAP IT ALWAYS CRASHES, which prevents me from getting the black borders!! EVEN ON THE BASIC HARD DIFFICULTY LEVEL, it crashes WELL BEFORE round 80. Every. Single. Freakin. Game. It is so frustrating and it having been happening for as long as it has, as often as it does, has gotten ridiculous. Please either change the freaking chimps so you can still get the chimps medal with black eyes (and thus black border) when the game crashes, or fix the crashes. \n\nThe game used to only crash when my son and I would play co-op and get into rounds 140+, and that would be infuriating and ridiculous when at least one of us would always be kicked and completely lose access to re-join the game. Now it\u2019s crashing on solo games sometimes before round 60, always before round 80, and it completely messes up the opportunity to get the medals/borders for maps that ninja kiwi designed to be a part of the game!

Why can\u2019t this app display the cards\u2019 front and backs simultaneously?\n\nSecond, do the creators know that the free versions of this app automatically translate words into your desired language when you put them in new cards?

There is no rendering the mask alone in its plain black-and-white form so you can see clearly if there are any spots you missed. \n\nIt's also unfortunate because you lose access to a lot of cool effects that are achievable by applying filters to masks.

The winter event was nice but i wish they would fix the randomization. That\u2019s been the main issue since day one. Update!!! All of the previously mentioned problems have not been resolved. Moreover, now when the game decides that you need to lose, it will allow players to land on your properties without having to pay you. I literally just quit a game where it did it twice in a row.

It often plays out less like random chance and more like a casino slot machine that is working against you. When you are on a winning streak, the other players always seem to end up in jail to avoid paying rent. At the same time, you somehow land on Park Place and Boardwalk two or even three times within just a few rounds. These patterns happen too often to feel like coincidence.\n\nThe game itself is excellent and I still recommend it, but the dice mechanics create the impression that outcomes are manipulated to make matches drag on or push you into losing. If the dice rolls were truly random this would be an outstanding experience without question.",

You rarely land on spaces that actually do anything. There used to be fun mini games but the computers never choose that option for some reason and rarely do you yourself land on it. It feels weird and soulless. As does most AI these days. It\u2019s really hard to get children and the game is barely 10 minutes long. Very disappointing upon opening after not playing for a while. I recommend just downloading the original app. This one used to be alot of fun but the developers are obvs going in a weird direction with the game play.",

                "review": "Ah, the 2000s \u2013 a golden era for interactive video games. One of the most iconic titles from that time was The Game of Life. The 2000s computer version of the game was ahead of its time, offering something that felt real, immersive, and surprisingly deep for a game about life\u2019s simple choices. You could pick your character\u2019s race, customize their appearance, and choose who you wanted to marry. The variety of life paths you could take was impressive, and the houses, the cars, the choices, they all felt like actual representations of real life. It wasn\u2019t just about winning; it was about the experience, about making decisions that felt meaningful.\n\nNow, fast-forward to the app version of The Game of Life and it feels like a shell of its former self. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there\u2019s still the basic gameplay of spinning a wheel and making choices, but where\u2019s the depth? Where\u2019s the variety? The modern version lacks the richness of character customization that the 2000s edition had. Back then, you could actually see your character\u2019s individuality shine through. But now? The characters are little more than pastel-colored pegs. Pink, purple, and blue\u2026what happened to the real diversity that made the game so much more relatable?\n\nAlso, don\u2019t get me started on the paid content in the new version. It\u2019s honestly just ridiculous how much stuff is locked behind paywalls. You can barely play the game without feeling like you're being pressured into purchasing extra features. The fun is sucked out of the experience when you\u2019re constantly being asked to pay for every little thing. People want to play a game that\u2019s fun, where they can just relax, make choices, and see how their life turns out, not feel like they\u2019re stuck in some endless transaction cycle. It\u2019s frustrating.\n\nThe nostalgia for the 2000s version is real. Back then, the game was fun and accessible. You didn't have to spend a ton of money just to enjoy it. The goal should be to capture that essence: a game where you get to experience life in all its colorful diversity, without having to constantly shell out cash for every little thing.\n\nIf the creators of The Game of Life want to keep it relevant, they need to focus on what made the 2000s version great. Bring back the variety. Let players see themselves in the game. Let us pick more than just a peg color. Make it feel like life - complex, diverse, and, yes, free to play. That\u2019s the real life we want, not just a hollow, transactional experience.",

This needs WAY more variety. You could be doing so much more with just that category alone. I\u2019m already sick of seeing the same ones.\nSo I figured, maybe the boards you have to pay for are more fun and I\u2019ll get some different outcomes. The map is exactly the same just different \u201csetting\u201d so the jobs and houses are different, but all the tiles are in the same exact places which is really pointless.\nEach board should be different paths or AT LEAST mix up the tiles if you\u2019re making me pay $5.99.\nMore creativity and random results  are needed if you\u2019re gonna be charging people like that.\nSpeaking of random results, none of this is really needed if the results aren\u2019t actually ever in your favor. I just played my last game because I played for an entire game where every single opponent of mine was constantly landing on Actions, and they all ended up with numbers over 5 for each attribute while I\u2019m stuck with 2, 3, and 5. Ridiculous. I began to predict what kind of tiles I\u2019ll land on and each time it\u2019s either landing on salary or paying taxes. But never in any game do I land on NEARLY as many \u201cactions\u201d as my opponents. \nWhat is the point of making this game that is literally meant to be chance and random if you\u2019re gonna have some level of control over my outcome? A waste of time and money. So much work needed.",

Also, I store all my soy beans to sell in June in large containers with trucks attached and just park and sit them until June. I also have dedicated plows for each of the four sections with tractors attached and all small fertilizers have a mini tractor attached to it as do all of my transport container.\n\nI literally do not have to disconnect or connect anything every month. I just get in the tractor and work.\n\nI recommend doing the German farm into four sections as it is easier.",

I have fairly slender fingers and I\u2019m dextrous, using iPhone 13 Pro Max, and even when being very careful selecting cards, I still miss fairly often.  The 2nd to left-most card is super difficult to select to discard.  Selecting a card to discard will often result in the wrong card being thrown away, regardless of how careful you are to touch it directly.  Also, after touching a card, it remains weirdly \u201csticky\u201d \u2014 i.e. it often won\u2019t go back into your hand, and you have to carefully click around your other cards, hoping to deselect it, lest it be played.  The issues are fairly constant; definitely recommend not spending $10 on this.  Just play on PC.",

Cards in my hand have gotten super sticky - very often when I tap to select they don\u2019t rise high enough up to be able to read the text and I\u2019ll have to tap them up and down 3 or 4 times, often have to tap a different card and go back to it before it\u2019ll pop up properly. \n\nI\u2019m methodical enough that it hasn\u2019t led to too many misplays, and I\u2019m never too proud to scum save when it does\u2026but it does make my turns take a lot longer and adds a lot of extra tapping and frustration. \n\nIt was running fine for years so I was surprised to see anything change this late into the game. So while on one hand I\u2019m happy to see this game is still getting some dev love on mobile, on the other all it\u2019s caused me is grief lol so hopefully they\u2019re still up for some more tweaking! It\u2019ll be an easy 5 stars with this one gripe fixed. Thanks!",

I really wanted this to work because like I said in my review, I have light sensitivity & I prefer my phone to be on dark mode (I can read everything better and it doesn\u2019t hurt my eyes so much) and some websites are now having options to be able to change to dark mode or will automatically change if that is your phones settings. But the majority don\u2019t have that yet so their background will be white. I have \u201cnight shift\u201d turned on for websites like that, but sometimes it\u2019s not enough and still will hurt my eyes/give me a headache. \n\nAnyways, it just didn\u2019t work for me. I had to un-install it because I was getting too frustrated with having to re-load sites, sites looking super weird and sites crashing all the time. I wasn\u2019t really sure what was going wrong but I thought maybe it had something to do with the noir extension and as soon as I turned it off safari started working fine. \nBummed!\n\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nJust purchased the app and I felt like I had to write a review to tell the devs thank you! I have really bad photophobia/light sensitivity, especially in the evening & at night, that causes super bad headaches and makes my eyes ache and hurt. I switch anything I can to dark mode, night shift etc. I even sometimes wear these goofy light sensitivity glasses (they block specific wavelengths of light). For a long time now I was so annoyed I couldn\u2019t change all of safari on dark mode (a few websites I could but that\u2019s it). I found this app randomly tonight and immediately bought and downloaded it. The instructions to install it on safari were very clear and I had it up and running in just a few minutes. The app also has other colors/themes you can choose besides just black which I thought was pretty cool if someone wants to change it to sepia instead or something. Also the app itself looks really nice and I thought for what it does I would have paid more than $3 for it so I appreciate the devs for keeping it at that price. Anyways, ty to the devs for making this!!",

I think you\u2019re supposed to move passengers between stations but there\u2019s no real strategy involved. They give you multiple lines but you only need one line. Set it in a loop to all stations and then sit and stare at your screen for hours while trains slooooowly move around, I guess. I just don\u2019t get what the point or the challenge is. It\u2019s a beautiful looking game though.",

It's been idk how many days that I have not even thought about this game at all. On one of my runs I watch the claw go down and grab a bunch of items and right when it started to come up one of the items I was going for immediately disappeared. When it's the games mechanic I can't get past it. I will never play this game again and wasted the money I spent on it. I hate free to play but this game makes me want to just play free to play so I am not wasting money like this. I am very disappointed. I like this game. It's pretty entertaining. I just bought it today and I am on my first run. I am on floor 16 and just started to notice stuff disappearing. So 2 turns I watched the magnet drop in the machine and immediately disappear. Third turn it drops lands on the other stuff and when I went to grab it, it disappeared. Next stage same floor I watched stuff fall and immediately disappear. The reason such a low rating is grabbing stuff is the whole point of the game. Can't grab stuff if it doesn't drop or show up like it should. Please fix.",

Always the sharpest looking. Always ready for productivity. Always in Apple\u2019s spotlight. But Things has been slowing down\u2026\n\nToday, iOS 26 launched. I woke up hopeful that Things would surprise us by giving us a new feature. Maybe a new UI refresh. Nope. Their update was a barebones update to stay \u201ccurrent\u201d. A glass icon and a glassy like plus button. Wooo thanks! \n\nI have bought every version of things. The visionOS release was strike one. A full price for a multi year app that just has translucent sidebars? Come on. I messaged the devs many times asking what most of us are asking and needing: attachment support, better markdown (the current setup is insanely stupid), collaboration, or even a refreshed coat of paint to not look like an older app. The responses we get? Thanks for the feedback, we aren\u2019t doing it. \n\nToday, I\u2019m uninstalling things. This big update from them is a joke. To the other devs who listen and keep the magic of Apple software release day still magical, thank you. To Cultured Code, thanks for the great years ranging all the way back to Things 1. You\u2019ve lost your touch, your magic. I hope you find it again and find joy in your work.",

For me it is a 1 out 5 for the simple fact that they have turned this into the greediest of cash grabs where something like 50% of all towers and 85% of all heroes are locked behind further paywalls, and not cheap ones either. Paying for all of these, event at their \u201cdiscounts price\u201d will cost you a further $50 on top of the price of the game itself. In other words, they want you to pay the price of a AAA console/PC game to play their mobile game. To add further insult to injury, most of the paid extras towers ar just towers from previous games, so you\u2019re paying an entire games worth of blackmail money for the privilege of using them in this game, even if you bought those previous games. The same is true of the DLC heroes except it\u2019s even worse - even if you ALREADY PAID for a DLC hero in a previous entry it isn\u2019t credited to you in this game.

Just wind up the music box to its maximum and then check for him. Withered freddy? No problem. Even on the last nights he isn\u2019t very active. If he moves, shine your light. However there IS a game breaking issue with withered Bonnie and sometimes withered chica. When I was on night 4, every time chica was in my office I would don my Freddy head. Guess what?  I\u2019m still killed regardless of what I\u2019m doing. I am currently on night 5 and I can\u2019t pass it because of withered Bonnie killing me no matter what. Pls fix this as I spent 10$. By update: THIS IS STUPID! AT 5:00 I WAS KILLED BY BONNIE BECAUSE OF THE GLITCH! STOP THIS AND IT WILL GO TO 5 STARS. Update #2: withered Freddy is doing this too. Also pls slow down the ai of everything due to me (who played fnaf 2 for 3 years) failing not even 5 minutes into the game. FIX THIS!!!!!!",

You have to come up with an original username so you are forced to try a bunch of things til you get one that nobody else has. Now a few years go by and you want to find more charts so you try to log in so you can access the forums. What was that username you made up on the fly when you first bought the app? Donn\u2019t know it? You are out of luck. There\u2019s a \u201cforgot password\u201d option, but no \u201cforgot username\u201d option. You spent 20-something dollars for the app, and it\u2019s pegged to your Apple ID. You are using the same device, same Apple ID you had when you bought the app. But no, you are locked out. You won\u2019t be getting in. Period.  So many things about this old, clunky app are just like this. Want to name a chart you just created? If a chart already exists for that song on any of the playlists you have previously downloaded, you will not be able to use that title. You\u2019ll have to call your chart All Of Me 2, or something like that. You\u2019ll find the whole app is riddled with nutty appendices on the names of common songs.

Every, single, time, I would open this app, there would be another glitch in my beats that needs updated. For example, the kicks won\u2019t work because I have to reinstall the input, or a certain effect doesn\u2019t work anymore. Now, after experiencing that same issue and attempting to troubleshoot it, I decided to delete the app and reinstall it to see if that would fix it. I\u2019ve done it in the past and it worked out so no problem. Except this time, ALL OF MY FILES WERE DELETED.\nEvery, single beat I\u2019ve made or worked on for the past 5 years is gone. Poof! Countless hours of effort to craft my own sounds, just for it to corrupt in a bad app and get lost somewhere. I tried recovering them, nothing works and they\u2019ve vanished. Now I don\u2019t even want to touch this app or the computer version. \n\nOverall, the experience was fun, but I would recommend investing your time in a different program that\u2019s more stable than this one. Otherwise, everything you\u2019ve worked on may be randomly deleted.\n\nP.S. I purchased half of all the add ons, after my initial purchase of the app, and this happened.",

I wish I hadn\u2019t done that because this app is now borderline unusable. Before the update, placing and removing notes was easy, straightforward. Placing notes is still the same way it was before the update, but removing them is inexplicably difficult due to the way the screen snaps to a position that places the note you were trying to remove on the very right of the screen?? This is especially obnoxious when using percussion since beats are removed when you tap them, so the screen snaps every time I want to remove a beat. The worst part is that the beat doesn\u2019t even get removed when this happens, so I have to keep tapping and the screen keeps snapping until I finally manage to remove it, it is so awful. I don\u2019t know what happened between then and now, but this needs to be fixed as soon as possible because this is honestly just unacceptable.",
