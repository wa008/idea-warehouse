The app\u2019s communication features are abysmal, making it nearly impossible for my team to stay on the same page. It\u2019s far from user-friendly\u2014my employees found the interface confusing and frustrating to navigate, leading to constant issues with scheduling.\n\nWhen we reached out to customer service and tech support for help, the experience was equally disappointing. The support team was unhelpful, and the issues persisted without resolution. After wasting time and energy, we switched to a much more user-friendly scheduling software that actually works for our team. I strongly recommend avoiding HotSchedules\u2014it\u2019s a headache not worth dealing with.",

Not an ideal, or really morally acceptable, time to hit somebody up for money, but that\u2019s your decision.\nFrom that point, I worked for two weeks and no one in management was authorized or able to finish my set-up process, citing a lack of customer support from the app.\nI have since discovered that the job was not the best fit, and if I would have listened to my gut feeling I would\u2019ve avoided that wasted time, but que ser\u00e1.  The simple fact is this app is a way for businesses to pass the buck onto their hourly wage earners, and I will use my last dying breath to urge people to avoid using it.\nPower to the proletariat!",
