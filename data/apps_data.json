The app\u2019s communication features are abysmal, making it nearly impossible for my team to stay on the same page. It\u2019s far from user-friendly\u2014my employees found the interface confusing and frustrating to navigate, leading to constant issues with scheduling.\n\nWhen we reached out to customer service and tech support for help, the experience was equally disappointing. The support team was unhelpful, and the issues persisted without resolution. After wasting time and energy, we switched to a much more user-friendly scheduling software that actually works for our team. I strongly recommend avoiding HotSchedules\u2014it\u2019s a headache not worth dealing with.",

Not an ideal, or really morally acceptable, time to hit somebody up for money, but that\u2019s your decision.\nFrom that point, I worked for two weeks and no one in management was authorized or able to finish my set-up process, citing a lack of customer support from the app.\nI have since discovered that the job was not the best fit, and if I would have listened to my gut feeling I would\u2019ve avoided that wasted time, but que ser\u00e1.

Over the past 1-2 months, it has been and still is CONSTANTLY crashing. I submitted a message to support team via ninja kiwi\u2019s website several weeks ago to make them aware if they weren\u2019t already. Before I did that, I had given it plenty of time to resolve after making absolutely sure the softwares for both the game and my iPhone were up-to-date. It\u2019s been a few weeks since submitting that message, and it is STILL crashing. I\u2019ve been trying to get black borders on maps, and in EVERY CHIMPS ATTEMPT I DO ON ANY MAP IT ALWAYS CRASHES, which prevents me from getting the black borders!! EVEN ON THE BASIC HARD DIFFICULTY LEVEL, it crashes WELL BEFORE round 80. Every. Single. Freakin. Game. It is so frustrating and it having been happening for as long as it has, as often as it does, has gotten ridiculous. Please either change the freaking chimps so you can still get the chimps medal with black eyes (and thus black border) when the game crashes, or fix the crashes. \n\nThe game used to only crash when my son and I would play co-op and get into rounds 140+, and that would be infuriating and ridiculous when at least one of us would always be kicked and completely lose access to re-join the game. Now it\u2019s crashing on solo games sometimes before round 60, always before round 80, and it completely messes up the opportunity to get the medals/borders for maps that ninja kiwi designed to be a part of the game! Sorry rant over. Please fix. This is ridic.",

Very tiresome when needing to sort through cards for language learning purposes when it doesn\u2019t show you the translation as well. Why can\u2019t this app display the cards\u2019 front and backs simultaneously?\n\nSecond, do the creators know that the free versions of this app automatically translate words into your desired language when you put them in new cards?

This one you have to upgrade the original engine and it takes 10X as long but doesn\u2019t really improve each upgrade. 1 full run will give you MAYBE 1 bar of upgrades out of like 10. So 10 runs to upgrade one area of your vehicle. Which there is like 7. The first game was just dumb, easy, super fun, and simple.

I have fairly slender fingers and I\u2019m dextrous, using iPhone 13 Pro Max, and even when being very careful selecting cards, I still miss fairly often.  The 2nd to left-most card is super difficult to select to discard.  Selecting a card to discard will often result in the wrong card being thrown away, regardless of how careful you are to touch it directly.  Also, after touching a card, it remains weirdly \u201csticky\u201d \u2014 i.e. it often won\u2019t go back into your hand, and you have to carefully click around your other cards, hoping to deselect it, lest it be played.

Cards in my hand have gotten super sticky - very often when I tap to select they don\u2019t rise high enough up to be able to read the text and I\u2019ll have to tap them up and down 3 or 4 times, often have to tap a different card and go back to it before it\u2019ll pop up properly. \n\nI\u2019m methodical enough that it hasn\u2019t led to too many misplays, and I\u2019m never too proud to scum save when it does\u2026but it does make my turns take a lot longer and adds a lot of extra tapping and frustration. \n\nIt was running fine for years so I was surprised to see anything change this late into the game. So while on one hand I\u2019m happy to see this game is still getting some dev love on mobile, on the other all it\u2019s caused me is grief lol so hopefully they\u2019re still up for some more tweaking!
