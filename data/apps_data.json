The app\u2019s communication features are abysmal, making it nearly impossible for my team to stay on the same page. It\u2019s far from user-friendly\u2014my employees found the interface confusing and frustrating to navigate, leading to constant issues with scheduling.\n\nWhen we reached out to customer service and tech support for help, the experience was equally disappointing. The support team was unhelpful, and the issues persisted without resolution. After wasting time and energy, we switched to a much more user-friendly scheduling software that actually works for our team. I strongly recommend avoiding HotSchedules\u2014it\u2019s a headache not worth dealing with.",

Not an ideal, or really morally acceptable, time to hit somebody up for money, but that\u2019s your decision.\nFrom that point, I worked for two weeks and no one in management was authorized or able to finish my set-up process, citing a lack of customer support from the app.\nI have since discovered that the job was not the best fit, and if I would have listened to my gut feeling I would\u2019ve avoided that wasted time, but que ser\u00e1.

Over the past 1-2 months, it has been and still is CONSTANTLY crashing. I submitted a message to support team via ninja kiwi\u2019s website several weeks ago to make them aware if they weren\u2019t already. Before I did that, I had given it plenty of time to resolve after making absolutely sure the softwares for both the game and my iPhone were up-to-date. It\u2019s been a few weeks since submitting that message, and it is STILL crashing. I\u2019ve been trying to get black borders on maps, and in EVERY CHIMPS ATTEMPT I DO ON ANY MAP IT ALWAYS CRASHES, which prevents me from getting the black borders!! EVEN ON THE BASIC HARD DIFFICULTY LEVEL, it crashes WELL BEFORE round 80. Every. Single. Freakin. Game. It is so frustrating and it having been happening for as long as it has, as often as it does, has gotten ridiculous. Please either change the freaking chimps so you can still get the chimps medal with black eyes (and thus black border) when the game crashes, or fix the crashes. \n\nThe game used to only crash when my son and I would play co-op and get into rounds 140+, and that would be infuriating and ridiculous when at least one of us would always be kicked and completely lose access to re-join the game. Now it\u2019s crashing on solo games sometimes before round 60, always before round 80, and it completely messes up the opportunity to get the medals/borders for maps that ninja kiwi designed to be a part of the game!

Very tiresome when needing to sort through cards for language learning purposes when it doesn\u2019t show you the translation as well. Why can\u2019t this app display the cards\u2019 front and backs simultaneously?\n\nSecond, do the creators know that the free versions of this app automatically translate words into your desired language when you put them in new cards?

This one you have to upgrade the original engine and it takes 10X as long but doesn\u2019t really improve each upgrade. 1 full run will give you MAYBE 1 bar of upgrades out of like 10. So 10 runs to upgrade one area of your vehicle. Which there is like 7. The first game was just dumb, easy, super fun, and simple.

I have fairly slender fingers and I\u2019m dextrous, using iPhone 13 Pro Max, and even when being very careful selecting cards, I still miss fairly often.  The 2nd to left-most card is super difficult to select to discard.  Selecting a card to discard will often result in the wrong card being thrown away, regardless of how careful you are to touch it directly.  Also, after touching a card, it remains weirdly \u201csticky\u201d \u2014 i.e. it often won\u2019t go back into your hand, and you have to carefully click around your other cards, hoping to deselect it, lest it be played.

Cards in my hand have gotten super sticky - very often when I tap to select they don\u2019t rise high enough up to be able to read the text and I\u2019ll have to tap them up and down 3 or 4 times, often have to tap a different card and go back to it before it\u2019ll pop up properly. \n\nI\u2019m methodical enough that it hasn\u2019t led to too many misplays, and I\u2019m never too proud to scum save when it does\u2026but it does make my turns take a lot longer and adds a lot of extra tapping and frustration. \n\nIt was running fine for years so I was surprised to see anything change this late into the game. So while on one hand I\u2019m happy to see this game is still getting some dev love on mobile, on the other all it\u2019s caused me is grief lol so hopefully they\u2019re still up for some more tweaking!

Also I use safari as my phone Internet browser) web pages would not load correctly. I would have to re-load the web pages pretty much all the time or sometimes re-loading wouldn\u2019t work and everything on the page would just look wonky. I really wanted this to work because like I said in my review, I have light sensitivity & I prefer my phone to be on dark mode (I can read everything better and it doesn\u2019t hurt my eyes so much) and some websites are now having options to be able to change to dark mode or will automatically change if that is your phones settings. But the majority don\u2019t have that yet so their background will be white. I have \u201cnight shift\u201d turned on for websites like that, but sometimes it\u2019s not enough and still will hurt my eyes/give me a headache. \n\nAnyways, it just didn\u2019t work for me. I had to un-install it because I was getting too frustrated with having to re-load sites, sites looking super weird and sites crashing all the time. I wasn\u2019t really sure what was going wrong but I thought maybe it had something to do with the noir extension and as soon as I turned it off safari started working fine. \nBummed!\n\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nJust purchased the app and I felt like I had to write a review to tell the devs thank you! I have really bad photophobia/light sensitivity, especially in the evening & at night, that causes super bad headaches and makes my eyes ache and hurt. I switch anything I can to dark mode, night shift etc. I even sometimes wear these goofy light sensitivity glasses (they block specific wavelengths of light). For a long time now I was so annoyed I couldn\u2019t change all of safari on dark mode (a few websites I could but that\u2019s it). I found this app randomly tonight and immediately bought and downloaded it. The instructions to install it on safari were very clear and I had it up and running in just a few minutes. The app also has other colors/themes you can choose besides just black which I thought was pretty cool if someone wants to change it to sepia instead or something. Also the app itself looks really nice and I thought for what it does I would have paid more than $3 for it so I appreciate the devs for keeping it at that price. Anyways, ty to the devs for making this!!",

The \"order ticket\" shows two ingredients out of the six or seven or 10 or however many ingredients the person ordered. How are you supposed to use a list of two ingredients to cook an order that contains many more ingredients than that? And the ingredients shown are just icons \u2013 there's no indication of what they actually are. So if two or three ingredients you could choose from happen to look very much alike, which several do, you're just going to have to guess which of the look-alike items they wanted. Truly bizarre and unplayable game. I'm going to appeal to the App Store to give me my money back.",

My first complaint is the game takes far too long to show variance in runs making it feel stale fast.\nSecond, the game is far too RNG dependent, the mechanic to increase chances of receiving certain synergistic items doesn\u2019t seem to be effective, you have practically no good choices even with heavy RNG manipulation and dozens of re rolls.

It's been idk how many days that I have not even thought about this game at all. On one of my runs I watch the claw go down and grab a bunch of items and right when it started to come up one of the items I was going for immediately disappeared. When it's the games mechanic I can't get past it. I will never play this game again and wasted the money I spent on it. I hate free to play but this game makes me want to just play free to play so I am not wasting money like this. I am very disappointed. I like this game. It's pretty entertaining. I just bought it today and I am on my first run. I am on floor 16 and just started to notice stuff disappearing. So 2 turns I watched the magnet drop in the machine and immediately disappear. Third turn it drops lands on the other stuff and when I went to grab it, it disappeared. Next stage same floor I watched stuff fall and immediately disappear. The reason such a low rating is grabbing stuff is the whole point of the game. Can't grab stuff if it doesn't drop or show up like it should. Please fix.",

If you try to drag the claw a millimeter it goes a centimeter and sometimes nowhere at all.  Maybe that\u2019s by design but it creates a bad experience.

Always the sharpest looking. Always ready for productivity. Always in Apple\u2019s spotlight. But Things has been slowing down\u2026\n\nToday, iOS 26 launched. I woke up hopeful that Things would surprise us by giving us a new feature. Maybe a new UI refresh. Nope. Their update was a barebones update to stay \u201ccurrent\u201d. A glass icon and a glassy like plus button. Wooo thanks! \n\nI have bought every version of things. The visionOS release was strike one. A full price for a multi year app that just has translucent sidebars? Come on. I messaged the devs many times asking what most of us are asking and needing: attachment support, better markdown (the current setup is insanely stupid), collaboration, or even a refreshed coat of paint to not look like an older app. The responses we get? Thanks for the feedback, we aren\u2019t doing it. \n\nToday, I\u2019m uninstalling things. This big update from them is a joke. To the other devs who listen and keep the magic of Apple software release day still magical, thank you. To Cultured Code, thanks for the great years ranging all the way back to Things 1.

For me it is a 1 out 5 for the simple fact that they have turned this into the greediest of cash grabs where something like 50% of all towers and 85% of all heroes are locked behind further paywalls, and not cheap ones either. Paying for all of these, event at their \u201cdiscounts price\u201d will cost you a further $50 on top of the price of the game itself. In other words, they want you to pay the price of a AAA console/PC game to play their mobile game. To add further insult to injury, most of the paid extras towers ar just towers from previous games, so you\u2019re paying an entire games worth of blackmail money for the privilege of using them in this game, even if you bought those previous games. The same is true of the DLC heroes except it\u2019s even worse - even if you ALREADY PAID for a DLC hero in a previous entry it isn\u2019t credited to you in this game.

                "review": "I have been a huge fan of the kingdom rush games since the first one came out, and these are the only mobile games I\u2019ve ever actually paid for. Kingdom rush 5 upholds the graphics, creativity, and humor of the series but is unfortunately the weakest game out of all of them in my opinion.\n\nI was disappointed to see the mechanism from the last game continue where you\u2019re only allotted 5 tower types that you preselect before starting a level. This was my main criticism of the last game and why the last game was the first one that I didn\u2019t enjoy as much. I miss the older mechanic where you could have up to 8 tower types available during gameplay, because it made it so much more interesting to strategize and it was more fun to see more variety on the map. I found myself never using a handful of towers through the whole play through because I was forced to prioritize which ones made it into gameplay. \n\nThe levels themselves were not very challenging and they didn\u2019t last long enough. I found myself barely getting any towers to be fully upgraded before I already beat the level, so I didn\u2019t even get to fully utilize a lot of the tower skills. I beat the main campaign fairly quickly. There also weren\u2019t any standout enemies, which made them all kind of meld together and made all the levels feel the same. There are still enemy types that I remember from the past games but none from this game really stuck with me. \n\nI don\u2019t mind the extra towers and heroes behind the extra paywall. I didn\u2019t purchase any of them and didn\u2019t feel like I was missing out that much. I think this developer definitely deserves to find ways to make more revenue as long as the base game stays at a reasonable price, which I think it does at the moment. Despite the criticisms, the game still upholds a high caliber with its creativity, style, and mechanics. I might take pause at buying into another installment if it comes, but this series still remains to be one of the best made for mobile games, and I\u2019ll likely continue to revisit some of the early installments for repeat play throughs.",

Just wind up the music box to its maximum and then check for him. Withered freddy? No problem. Even on the last nights he isn\u2019t very active. If he moves, shine your light. However there IS a game breaking issue with withered Bonnie and sometimes withered chica. When I was on night 4, every time chica was in my office I would don my Freddy head. Guess what?  I\u2019m still killed regardless of what I\u2019m doing. I am currently on night 5 and I can\u2019t pass it because of withered Bonnie killing me no matter what. Pls fix this as I spent 10$. By update: THIS IS STUPID! AT 5:00 I WAS KILLED BY BONNIE BECAUSE OF THE GLITCH! STOP THIS AND IT WILL GO TO 5 STARS. Update #2: withered Freddy is doing this too. Also pls slow down the ai of everything due to me (who played fnaf 2 for 3 years) failing not even 5 minutes into the game. FIX THIS!!!!!!",

This is obviously stupid and they went out of their way to avoid using iCloud backup for reasons that I can\u2019t fathom.",
