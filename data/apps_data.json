Also I use safari as my phone Internet browser) web pages would not load correctly. I would have to re-load the web pages pretty much all the time or sometimes re-loading wouldn\u2019t work and everything on the page would just look wonky. I really wanted this to work because like I said in my review, I have light sensitivity & I prefer my phone to be on dark mode (I can read everything better and it doesn\u2019t hurt my eyes so much) and some websites are now having options to be able to change to dark mode or will automatically change if that is your phones settings. But the majority don\u2019t have that yet so their background will be white. I have \u201cnight shift\u201d turned on for websites like that, but sometimes it\u2019s not enough and still will hurt my eyes/give me a headache. \n\nAnyways, it just didn\u2019t work for me. I had to un-install it because I was getting too frustrated with having to re-load sites, sites looking super weird and sites crashing all the time. I wasn\u2019t really sure what was going wrong but I thought maybe it had something to do with the noir extension and as soon as I turned it off safari started working fine. \nBummed!\n\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nJust purchased the app and I felt like I had to write a review to tell the devs thank you! I have really bad photophobia/light sensitivity, especially in the evening & at night, that causes super bad headaches and makes my eyes ache and hurt. I switch anything I can to dark mode, night shift etc. I even sometimes wear these goofy light sensitivity glasses (they block specific wavelengths of light). For a long time now I was so annoyed I couldn\u2019t change all of safari on dark mode (a few websites I could but that\u2019s it). I found this app randomly tonight and immediately bought and downloaded it. The instructions to install it on safari were very clear and I had it up and running in just a few minutes. The app also has other colors/themes you can choose besides just black which I thought was pretty cool if someone wants to change it to sepia instead or something. Also the app itself looks really nice and I thought for what it does I would have paid more than $3 for it so I appreciate the devs for keeping it at that price. Anyways, ty to the devs for making this!!",

When it's the games mechanic I can't get past it. I will never play this game again and wasted the money I spent on it. I hate free to play but this game makes me want to just play free to play so I am not wasting money like this. I am very disappointed. I like this game. It's pretty entertaining. I just bought it today and I am on my first run. I am on floor 16 and just started to notice stuff disappearing. So 2 turns I watched the magnet drop in the machine and immediately disappear. Third turn it drops lands on the other stuff and when I went to grab it, it disappeared. Next stage same floor I watched stuff fall and immediately disappear. The reason such a low rating is grabbing stuff is the whole point of the game. Can't grab stuff if it doesn't drop or show up like it should. Please fix.",

Things was always an app that was distinctive in its approach to its user interface, acting like virtual paper that separated and expanded. To be honest, the user interface follows principles more similar to Google's Material Design in that fashion.

Always the sharpest looking. Always ready for productivity. Always in Apple\u2019s spotlight. But Things has been slowing down\u2026\n\nToday, iOS 26 launched. I woke up hopeful that Things would surprise us by giving us a new feature. Maybe a new UI refresh. Nope. Their update was a barebones update to stay \u201ccurrent\u201d. A glass icon and a glassy like plus button. Wooo thanks! \n\nI have bought every version of things. The visionOS release was strike one. A full price for a multi year app that just has translucent sidebars? Come on. I messaged the devs many times asking what most of us are asking and needing: attachment support, better markdown (the current setup is insanely stupid), collaboration, or even a refreshed coat of paint to not look like an older app. The responses we get? Thanks for the feedback, we aren\u2019t doing it. \n\nToday, I\u2019m uninstalling things. This big update from them is a joke. To the other devs who listen and keep the magic of Apple software release day still magical, thank you. To Cultured Code, thanks for the great years ranging all the way back to Things 1.

For me it is a 1 out 5 for the simple fact that they have turned this into the greediest of cash grabs where something like 50% of all towers and 85% of all heroes are locked behind further paywalls, and not cheap ones either. Paying for all of these, event at their \u201cdiscounts price\u201d will cost you a further $50 on top of the price of the game itself. In other words, they want you to pay the price of a AAA console/PC game to play their mobile game. To add further insult to injury, most of the paid extras towers ar just towers from previous games, so you\u2019re paying an entire games worth of blackmail money for the privilege of using them in this game, even if you bought those previous games. The same is true of the DLC heroes except it\u2019s even worse - even if you ALREADY PAID for a DLC hero in a previous entry it isn\u2019t credited to you in this game. I\u2019m sure the actual designers didn\u2019t make these decisions but the game is a shameful cash grab that\u2019s unworthy of its own legacy.",

                "review": "I have been a huge fan of the kingdom rush games since the first one came out, and these are the only mobile games I\u2019ve ever actually paid for. Kingdom rush 5 upholds the graphics, creativity, and humor of the series but is unfortunately the weakest game out of all of them in my opinion.\n\nI was disappointed to see the mechanism from the last game continue where you\u2019re only allotted 5 tower types that you preselect before starting a level. This was my main criticism of the last game and why the last game was the first one that I didn\u2019t enjoy as much. I miss the older mechanic where you could have up to 8 tower types available during gameplay, because it made it so much more interesting to strategize and it was more fun to see more variety on the map. I found myself never using a handful of towers through the whole play through because I was forced to prioritize which ones made it into gameplay. \n\nThe levels themselves were not very challenging and they didn\u2019t last long enough. I found myself barely getting any towers to be fully upgraded before I already beat the level, so I didn\u2019t even get to fully utilize a lot of the tower skills. I beat the main campaign fairly quickly. There also weren\u2019t any standout enemies, which made them all kind of meld together and made all the levels feel the same. There are still enemy types that I remember from the past games but none from this game really stuck with me. \n\nI don\u2019t mind the extra towers and heroes behind the extra paywall. I didn\u2019t purchase any of them and didn\u2019t feel like I was missing out that much. I think this developer definitely deserves to find ways to make more revenue as long as the base game stays at a reasonable price, which I think it does at the moment. Despite the criticisms, the game still upholds a high caliber with its creativity, style, and mechanics.

Just wind up the music box to its maximum and then check for him. Withered freddy? No problem. Even on the last nights he isn\u2019t very active. If he moves, shine your light. However there IS a game breaking issue with withered Bonnie and sometimes withered chica. When I was on night 4, every time chica was in my office I would don my Freddy head. Guess what?  I\u2019m still killed regardless of what I\u2019m doing. I am currently on night 5 and I can\u2019t pass it because of withered Bonnie killing me no matter what. Pls fix this as I spent 10$. By update: THIS IS STUPID! AT 5:00 I WAS KILLED BY BONNIE BECAUSE OF THE GLITCH! STOP THIS AND IT WILL GO TO 5 STARS. Update #2: withered Freddy is doing this too. Also pls slow down the ai of everything due to me (who played fnaf 2 for 3 years) failing not even 5 minutes into the game. FIX THIS!!!!!!",

You have to come up with an original username so you are forced to try a bunch of things til you get one that nobody else has.

You spent 20-something dollars for the app, and it\u2019s pegged to your Apple ID. You are using the same device, same Apple ID you had when you bought the app. But no, you are locked out. You won\u2019t be getting in. Period.  So many things about this old, clunky app are just like this. Want to name a chart you just created? If a chart already exists for that song on any of the playlists you have previously downloaded, you will not be able to use that title. You\u2019ll have to call your chart All Of Me 2, or something like that. You\u2019ll find the whole app is riddled with nutty appendices on the names of common songs.

No error messages whatsoever. We found out by accident when speaking IRL. Trusting the other\u2019s Threema IDs resolved it\n- extremely limited set of reaction emojis. Why can\u2019t I use the full emoji pallet to express my emotions\n- can\u2019t port data backups from android to iOS???\n- when you are offline for some time and get online again you are spammed by notifications, instead of Threema batching them in a single notification/one per chat\n\nThreema for Desktop is the only good addition that I\u2019ve seen in 5+ years. \n\nI don\u2019t see a reason to pay for Threema when there are better alternatives (Signal being the obvious one)",

And I was so exited to see I could download the game and play now that I\u2019m older, nevertheless I am sad to say that I am disappointed with the game I received. The mobile game is very outdated and seems to be like one of the older files. I would really like to see this game be updated to a more recent file because unlike the computer game you can\u2019t customize your own character and the graphics are very underwhelming. This is no hate to the game just an attempt to see a more developed version. Thank you for your time and I hope this can be taken into consideration.",

It\u2019s missing history of Susanna, Bel Of The dragon and the Prayer of Mannesah.\n2. Unlike other Bible apps, it does not sink across your different devices. He wants you to pay a fee for each device like your desktop, iPad and iPhone. Why not charge one flat fee and they sync across all devices? \n3. And this last one could be just a personal preference. Why do I have to hold down the scripture every time to add adjustments to a note already established. I should be able to click on that note one time to add or delete commentary or precepts.\n\nLastly, I want to say that I don\u2019t have a problem paying for this app and it services.

But accessibility is poor (can\u2019t check count in between hands to double check if I am on track or not) and it is just overwhelmingly underdeveloped and in this day and age, $5 is such an overrated price for a simulation with like 3 features. $2 at best (Including ALL features).",

Where I am at, you can see the string of 14ers, starting with Mt. Langley.  The app does NOT detect any of them.  Also, was just on the 97 in NorCal with Mt. Shasta literally hulking right next to me on the Freeway.  No dice!!!  It did not detect it.  It has only ever picked up little mountains that you are close to.  I thought maybe I was too far away, but when I was right next to Shasta and the app didn\u2019t detect it, I was pretty much done with it.",

Try to send family from overseas videos and they just take too long. Even a 10 second video I was trying to send saying hello takes for ever. Please update your stuff. There are literally so many apps that have faster download and upload speed than TeleGuard. It might not be working as good but others definitely have their media sending and downloading issue handled. Also if someone is sending media to someone why would they be required to download it manually. It should automatically be downloaded if someone send them something. \n\nOn another note. Why does media expire after a certain amount of time? I heard it was a TeleGuard thing where after two weeks the media will expire. Please remove that or fix it to keep media content on there. \n\nPlease work on that. Like REALLY work on it. Telegram puts yall to shame.",

However I found this game to be quite difficult from the very beginning and all the maps are locked behind either beating the previous level on a certain difficulty or a paywall.  I know people will say \u2018get good\u2019, but the game also doesn\u2019t do a good job of giving you hints on how to improve and all the bonus items are again locked behind a paywall so you can\u2019t even grind for them.  This game is a big disappointment due to the learning curve.  And if I don\u2019t want to pay for the zombies or vampires, you have to beat all the levels on the hard mode.  I cannot recommend this to anyone but the most die hard fan of this game.  I hope the develop has improved on their other titles.\n\nUpdate:  I beat all the main game plagues on Brutal difficulty and the game only allowed me to play the shadow/vampire plague once and then locked me out to buy even though it said it would open up if I beat the main plagues on that difficulty level. What is the deal.  I know people like this game but it seems like it it always blocking me from trying the next thing.",

Over the past 1-2 months, it has been and still is CONSTANTLY crashing. I submitted a message to support team via ninja kiwi\u2019s website several weeks ago to make them aware if they weren\u2019t already. Before I did that, I had given it plenty of time to resolve after making absolutely sure the softwares for both the game and my iPhone were up-to-date. It\u2019s been a few weeks since submitting that message, and it is STILL crashing. I\u2019ve been trying to get black borders on maps, and in EVERY CHIMPS ATTEMPT I DO ON ANY MAP IT ALWAYS CRASHES, which prevents me from getting the black borders!! EVEN ON THE BASIC HARD DIFFICULTY LEVEL, it crashes WELL BEFORE round 80. Every. Single. Freakin. Game. It is so frustrating and it having been happening for as long as it has, as often as it does, has gotten ridiculous. Please either change the freaking chimps so you can still get the chimps medal with black eyes (and thus black border) when the game crashes, or fix the crashes. \n\nThe game used to only crash when my son and I would play co-op and get into rounds 140+, and that would be infuriating and ridiculous when at least one of us would always be kicked and completely lose access to re-join the game. Now it\u2019s crashing on solo games sometimes before round 60, always before round 80, and it completely messes up the opportunity to get the medals/borders for maps that ninja kiwi designed to be a part of the game!

That would be fine for my collage- and meme-making purposes HOWEVER you cannot paint directly onto a mask. \n\nYour options for modifying the mask directly are either A) use the built-in selection tools (with the underlying layer turned off, so you can see the mask clearly) or B) use brushes and black/white to modify it ONLY with the underlying layer turned on. There is no rendering the mask alone in its plain black-and-white form so you can see clearly if there are any spots you missed. \n\nIt's also unfortunate because you lose access to a lot of cool effects that are achievable by applying filters to masks. It's so vexing because you can see the underlying mask in its true black-and-white form in the thumbnail for the mask, there's just no working on it in full screen.

I\u2019ve probably had this game since mid 2010s and the fact that I still come back to it sometimes says a lot. \n\nHOWEVER, like many others have already said, there\u2019s content I paid REAL MONEY for back in the day that I no longer have access to. Decks and grips I paid for back in the day are completely gone without a trace. A 3 pack of maps I bought show up but only 1 of the 3 will load. The others say \u201cinvalid lighting data\u201d. It gives the instructions to delete the content and redownload but nothing works.\n\nThe fact that they are asking you to pay a subscription for all features of the game when they don\u2019t even take care of the OGs who got them to where they are now is a disgrace. \n\nZERO BIG BOOMS \u274c\ud83d\udcaa",

I have many decks and grip tape bundles purchased with real money that are just gone. Support responds whenever they feel like it or they just don\u2019t. Connecting accounts is painstakingly hard for no reason at all. Always a problem trying to get Facebook or Apple to connect. The gameplay and idea is there. However I\u2019m afraid the developers are dull and money hungry. Stop pushing for buying all this paid content when it randomly disappears so there is no point. And stop adding new content and not fixing old bugs. \u201cMissing Light Data\u201d on a mobile game map? Seriously? Even small unity developers don\u2019t throw errors like that. Fix it!",

Also, after touching a card, it remains weirdly \u201csticky\u201d \u2014 i.e. it often won\u2019t go back into your hand, and you have to carefully click around your other cards, hoping to deselect it, lest it be played.

Cards in my hand have gotten super sticky - very often when I tap to select they don\u2019t rise high enough up to be able to read the text and I\u2019ll have to tap them up and down 3 or 4 times, often have to tap a different card and go back to it before it\u2019ll pop up properly. \n\nI\u2019m methodical enough that it hasn\u2019t led to too many misplays, and I\u2019m never too proud to scum save when it does\u2026but it does make my turns take a lot longer and adds a lot of extra tapping and frustration. \n\nIt was running fine for years so I was surprised to see anything change this late into the game. So while on one hand I\u2019m happy to see this game is still getting some dev love on mobile, on the other all it\u2019s caused me is grief lol so hopefully they\u2019re still up for some more tweaking!
