All it did was erase all of my progress.\n\nI deleted it again  and won\u2019t download again unless changes happen. They should sell this app to someone who will fix these issues",

During this time, I heard about this app but always managed fine in the various places I lived and traveled (international and domestic). \n\nI finally ended up paying for the app about 2 months ago when I found myself in a village in Basque country where there was rarely vegetarian food on menus and a number of restaurants that did have more veg options were closed. No options were listed on HappyCow. Walking around, I eventually found a restaurant that offered a salad that could be made vegetarian or vegan and it was delicious. I took the time to submit this restaurant and meal to HappyCow, as I was very thankful to have found it and wished it had been something I\u2019d found when checking the app. My submission was rejected because the restaurant serves primarily non-vegetarian food, which was disappointing. \n\nI continued to try to use the app in France and Spain over the next several weeks. HappyCow never once helped me find a vegetarian or vegan place to eat. There were either 1\u20132 listings with one or two bad reviews or there were simply no listings. \n\nI felt like I was using an app that had been abandoned. It was a ghost town. \n\nI\u2019ll keep using Yelp and Google to find vegetarian/vegan food \u2014 I\u2019ve had much more luck with these free tools.\n\nEdit in response to developer response: I appreciate that this is a small team; however, the app was a disappointment for me, a vegan, and my personal experience is that Yelp and Google are more accurate and up to date.",

Over the past 1-2 months, it has been and still is CONSTANTLY crashing. I submitted a message to support team via ninja kiwi\u2019s website several weeks ago to make them aware if they weren\u2019t already. Before I did that, I had given it plenty of time to resolve after making absolutely sure the softwares for both the game and my iPhone were up-to-date. It\u2019s been a few weeks since submitting that message, and it is STILL crashing. I\u2019ve been trying to get black borders on maps, and in EVERY CHIMPS ATTEMPT I DO ON ANY MAP IT ALWAYS CRASHES, which prevents me from getting the black borders!! EVEN ON THE BASIC HARD DIFFICULTY LEVEL, it crashes WELL BEFORE round 80. Every. Single. Freakin. Game. It is so frustrating and it having been happening for as long as it has, as often as it does, has gotten ridiculous. Please either change the freaking chimps so you can still get the chimps medal with black eyes (and thus black border) when the game crashes, or fix the crashes. \n\nThe game used to only crash when my son and I would play co-op and get into rounds 140+, and that would be infuriating and ridiculous when at least one of us would always be kicked and completely lose access to re-join the game. Now it\u2019s crashing on solo games sometimes before round 60, always before round 80, and it completely messes up the opportunity to get the medals/borders for maps that ninja kiwi designed to be a part of the game! Sorry rant over. Please fix. This is ridic.",

It\u2019s no wonder why the knockoffs are more popular when this app costs $25 and looks like it hasn\u2019t been updated in over a decade, and the free versions offer better features. For example, when viewing all cards in a deck, the only option is to browse by the front of the cards only. Very tiresome when needing to sort through cards for language learning purposes when it doesn\u2019t show you the translation as well. Why can\u2019t this app display the cards\u2019 front and backs simultaneously?\n\nSecond, do the creators know that the free versions of this app automatically translate words into your desired language when you put them in new cards? For $25, why can\u2019t this app do the same?\n\nThis app does not seem relevant anymore. There are plenty of better alternatives out there for FREE. Please do not waste your money.",

There is no rendering the mask alone in its plain black-and-white form so you can see clearly if there are any spots you missed. \n\nIt's also unfortunate because you lose access to a lot of cool effects that are achievable by applying filters to masks. It's so vexing because you can see the underlying mask in its true black-and-white form in the thumbnail for the mask, there's just no working on it in full screen.

                "review": "Ah, the 2000s \u2013 a golden era for interactive video games. One of the most iconic titles from that time was The Game of Life. The 2000s computer version of the game was ahead of its time, offering something that felt real, immersive, and surprisingly deep for a game about life\u2019s simple choices. You could pick your character\u2019s race, customize their appearance, and choose who you wanted to marry. The variety of life paths you could take was impressive, and the houses, the cars, the choices, they all felt like actual representations of real life. It wasn\u2019t just about winning; it was about the experience, about making decisions that felt meaningful.\n\nNow, fast-forward to the app version of The Game of Life and it feels like a shell of its former self. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there\u2019s still the basic gameplay of spinning a wheel and making choices, but where\u2019s the depth? Where\u2019s the variety? The modern version lacks the richness of character customization that the 2000s edition had. Back then, you could actually see your character\u2019s individuality shine through. But now? The characters are little more than pastel-colored pegs. Pink, purple, and blue\u2026what happened to the real diversity that made the game so much more relatable?\n\nAlso, don\u2019t get me started on the paid content in the new version. It\u2019s honestly just ridiculous how much stuff is locked behind paywalls. You can barely play the game without feeling like you're being pressured into purchasing extra features. The fun is sucked out of the experience when you\u2019re constantly being asked to pay for every little thing. People want to play a game that\u2019s fun, where they can just relax, make choices, and see how their life turns out, not feel like they\u2019re stuck in some endless transaction cycle. It\u2019s frustrating.\n\nThe nostalgia for the 2000s version is real. Back then, the game was fun and accessible. You didn't have to spend a ton of money just to enjoy it. The goal should be to capture that essence: a game where you get to experience life in all its colorful diversity, without having to constantly shell out cash for every little thing.\n\nIf the creators of The Game of Life want to keep it relevant, they need to focus on what made the 2000s version great. Bring back the variety. Let players see themselves in the game. Let us pick more than just a peg color. Make it feel like life - complex, diverse, and, yes, free to play. That\u2019s the real life we want, not just a hollow, transactional experience.",

This needs WAY more variety. You could be doing so much more with just that category alone. I\u2019m already sick of seeing the same ones.\nSo I figured, maybe the boards you have to pay for are more fun and I\u2019ll get some different outcomes. The map is exactly the same just different \u201csetting\u201d so the jobs and houses are different, but all the tiles are in the same exact places which is really pointless.\nEach board should be different paths or AT LEAST mix up the tiles if you\u2019re making me pay $5.99.\nMore creativity and random results  are needed if you\u2019re gonna be charging people like that.\nSpeaking of random results, none of this is really needed if the results aren\u2019t actually ever in your favor. I just played my last game because I played for an entire game where every single opponent of mine was constantly landing on Actions, and they all ended up with numbers over 5 for each attribute while I\u2019m stuck with 2, 3, and 5. Ridiculous. I began to predict what kind of tiles I\u2019ll land on and each time it\u2019s either landing on salary or paying taxes. But never in any game do I land on NEARLY as many \u201cactions\u201d as my opponents. \nWhat is the point of making this game that is literally meant to be chance and random if you\u2019re gonna have some level of control over my outcome? A waste of time and money. So much work needed.",

Also, I store all my soy beans to sell in June in large containers with trucks attached and just park and sit them until June. I also have dedicated plows for each of the four sections with tractors attached and all small fertilizers have a mini tractor attached to it as do all of my transport container.\n\nI literally do not have to disconnect or connect anything every month.

This one you have to upgrade the original engine and it takes 10X as long but doesn\u2019t really improve each upgrade. 1 full run will give you MAYBE 1 bar of upgrades out of like 10.

The 2nd to left-most card is super difficult to select to discard.  Selecting a card to discard will often result in the wrong card being thrown away, regardless of how careful you are to touch it directly.  Also, after touching a card, it remains weirdly \u201csticky\u201d \u2014 i.e. it often won\u2019t go back into your hand, and you have to carefully click around your other cards, hoping to deselect it, lest it be played.

Cards in my hand have gotten super sticky - very often when I tap to select they don\u2019t rise high enough up to be able to read the text and I\u2019ll have to tap them up and down 3 or 4 times, often have to tap a different card and go back to it before it\u2019ll pop up properly. \n\nI\u2019m methodical enough that it hasn\u2019t led to too many misplays, and I\u2019m never too proud to scum save when it does\u2026but it does make my turns take a lot longer and adds a lot of extra tapping and frustration. \n\nIt was running fine for years so I was surprised to see anything change this late into the game. So while on one hand I\u2019m happy to see this game is still getting some dev love on mobile, on the other all it\u2019s caused me is grief lol so hopefully they\u2019re still up for some more tweaking!

Also I use safari as my phone Internet browser) web pages would not load correctly. I would have to re-load the web pages pretty much all the time or sometimes re-loading wouldn\u2019t work and everything on the page would just look wonky. I really wanted this to work because like I said in my review, I have light sensitivity & I prefer my phone to be on dark mode (I can read everything better and it doesn\u2019t hurt my eyes so much) and some websites are now having options to be able to change to dark mode or will automatically change if that is your phones settings. But the majority don\u2019t have that yet so their background will be white. I have \u201cnight shift\u201d turned on for websites like that, but sometimes it\u2019s not enough and still will hurt my eyes/give me a headache. \n\nAnyways, it just didn\u2019t work for me. I had to un-install it because I was getting too frustrated with having to re-load sites, sites looking super weird and sites crashing all the time. I wasn\u2019t really sure what was going wrong but I thought maybe it had something to do with the noir extension and as soon as I turned it off safari started working fine. \nBummed!\n\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nJust purchased the app and I felt like I had to write a review to tell the devs thank you! I have really bad photophobia/light sensitivity, especially in the evening & at night, that causes super bad headaches and makes my eyes ache and hurt. I switch anything I can to dark mode, night shift etc. I even sometimes wear these goofy light sensitivity glasses (they block specific wavelengths of light). For a long time now I was so annoyed I couldn\u2019t change all of safari on dark mode (a few websites I could but that\u2019s it). I found this app randomly tonight and immediately bought and downloaded it. The instructions to install it on safari were very clear and I had it up and running in just a few minutes. The app also has other colors/themes you can choose besides just black which I thought was pretty cool if someone wants to change it to sepia instead or something. Also the app itself looks really nice and I thought for what it does I would have paid more than $3 for it so I appreciate the devs for keeping it at that price. Anyways, ty to the devs for making this!!",

It's been idk how many days that I have not even thought about this game at all. On one of my runs I watch the claw go down and grab a bunch of items and right when it started to come up one of the items I was going for immediately disappeared. When it's the games mechanic I can't get past it. I will never play this game again and wasted the money I spent on it. I hate free to play but this game makes me want to just play free to play so I am not wasting money like this. I am very disappointed. I like this game. It's pretty entertaining. I just bought it today and I am on my first run. I am on floor 16 and just started to notice stuff disappearing. So 2 turns I watched the magnet drop in the machine and immediately disappear. Third turn it drops lands on the other stuff and when I went to grab it, it disappeared. Next stage same floor I watched stuff fall and immediately disappear. The reason such a low rating is grabbing stuff is the whole point of the game. Can't grab stuff if it doesn't drop or show up like it should. Please fix.",

I woke up hopeful that Things would surprise us by giving us a new feature. Maybe a new UI refresh. Nope. Their update was a barebones update to stay \u201ccurrent\u201d. A glass icon and a glassy like plus button. Wooo thanks! \n\nI have bought every version of things. The visionOS release was strike one. A full price for a multi year app that just has translucent sidebars? Come on. I messaged the devs many times asking what most of us are asking and needing: attachment support, better markdown (the current setup is insanely stupid), collaboration, or even a refreshed coat of paint to not look like an older app. The responses we get? Thanks for the feedback, we aren\u2019t doing it. \n\nToday, I\u2019m uninstalling things. This big update from them is a joke. To the other devs who listen and keep the magic of Apple software release day still magical, thank you. To Cultured Code, thanks for the great years ranging all the way back to Things 1.

For me it is a 1 out 5 for the simple fact that they have turned this into the greediest of cash grabs where something like 50% of all towers and 85% of all heroes are locked behind further paywalls, and not cheap ones either. Paying for all of these, event at their \u201cdiscounts price\u201d will cost you a further $50 on top of the price of the game itself. In other words, they want you to pay the price of a AAA console/PC game to play their mobile game. To add further insult to injury, most of the paid extras towers ar just towers from previous games, so you\u2019re paying an entire games worth of blackmail money for the privilege of using them in this game, even if you bought those previous games. The same is true of the DLC heroes except it\u2019s even worse - even if you ALREADY PAID for a DLC hero in a previous entry it isn\u2019t credited to you in this game. I\u2019m sure the actual designers didn\u2019t make these decisions but the game is a shameful cash grab that\u2019s unworthy of its own legacy.",

                "review": "I have been a huge fan of the kingdom rush games since the first one came out, and these are the only mobile games I\u2019ve ever actually paid for. Kingdom rush 5 upholds the graphics, creativity, and humor of the series but is unfortunately the weakest game out of all of them in my opinion.\n\nI was disappointed to see the mechanism from the last game continue where you\u2019re only allotted 5 tower types that you preselect before starting a level. This was my main criticism of the last game and why the last game was the first one that I didn\u2019t enjoy as much. I miss the older mechanic where you could have up to 8 tower types available during gameplay, because it made it so much more interesting to strategize and it was more fun to see more variety on the map. I found myself never using a handful of towers through the whole play through because I was forced to prioritize which ones made it into gameplay. \n\nThe levels themselves were not very challenging and they didn\u2019t last long enough. I found myself barely getting any towers to be fully upgraded before I already beat the level, so I didn\u2019t even get to fully utilize a lot of the tower skills. I beat the main campaign fairly quickly. There also weren\u2019t any standout enemies, which made them all kind of meld together and made all the levels feel the same. There are still enemy types that I remember from the past games but none from this game really stuck with me. \n\nI don\u2019t mind the extra towers and heroes behind the extra paywall. I didn\u2019t purchase any of them and didn\u2019t feel like I was missing out that much. I think this developer definitely deserves to find ways to make more revenue as long as the base game stays at a reasonable price, which I think it does at the moment. Despite the criticisms, the game still upholds a high caliber with its creativity, style, and mechanics. I might take pause at buying into another installment if it comes, but this series still remains to be one of the best made for mobile games, and I\u2019ll likely continue to revisit some of the early installments for repeat play throughs.",

This is the 5th game in the series, did they add something that justifies a $7 price tag? Not that I\u2019m aware of. While I am a fan of the KR series from a gameplay standpoint. The $$$ is getting worse as the game remains for the most part. It\u2019s a shame. But if you got money to burn and love the KR TD style this game is fine. Just don\u2019t expect the game to come with all of the content available without additional spending. RIP the App Store game industry",

Just wind up the music box to its maximum and then check for him. Withered freddy? No problem. Even on the last nights he isn\u2019t very active. If he moves, shine your light. However there IS a game breaking issue with withered Bonnie and sometimes withered chica. When I was on night 4, every time chica was in my office I would don my Freddy head. Guess what?  I\u2019m still killed regardless of what I\u2019m doing. I am currently on night 5 and I can\u2019t pass it because of withered Bonnie killing me no matter what. Pls fix this as I spent 10$. By update: THIS IS STUPID! AT 5:00 I WAS KILLED BY BONNIE BECAUSE OF THE GLITCH! STOP THIS AND IT WILL GO TO 5 STARS. Update #2: withered Freddy is doing this too. Also pls slow down the ai of everything due to me (who played fnaf 2 for 3 years) failing not even 5 minutes into the game. FIX THIS!!!!!!",

At first I thought $1.99 was a modest price for the revival of the Purble Place I remember, but this game simply isn\u2019t it. Although most of the visuals are wonderful, I feel a lot more effort could have been put into the actual gameplay.

Now I don\u2019t even want to touch this app or the computer version. \n\nOverall, the experience was fun, but I would recommend investing your time in a different program that\u2019s more stable than this one.

No error messages whatsoever. We found out by accident when speaking IRL. Trusting the other\u2019s Threema IDs resolved it\n- extremely limited set of reaction emojis.

It\u2019s missing history of Susanna, Bel Of The dragon and the Prayer of Mannesah.\n2. Unlike other Bible apps, it does not sink across your different devices. He wants you to pay a fee for each device like your desktop, iPad and iPhone. Why not charge one flat fee and they sync across all devices? \n3. And this last one could be just a personal preference. Why do I have to hold down the scripture every time to add adjustments to a note already established. I should be able to click on that note one time to add or delete commentary or precepts.\n\nLastly, I want to say that I don\u2019t have a problem paying for this app and it services. It has potential. But the fact that I\u2019m paying for a app that\u2019s incomplete in my opinion because it\u2019s missing books is unfair.

There have been a couple times where I came close to beating it, and there have been a couple nights where I got jumpscared exactly at the start of the game.

That just seems like malware activity if I\u2019m honest. \n\nAgain, please would you update your games and stop them from doing this annoying behavior?\n\nOutside of this problem I really enjoy so many of the Papa Louie\u2019s video games a lot. I\u2019ve played quite a few of them to completion. I definitely would recommend their titles but I just wish they would get rid of this annoying tactic please. Thank you.",

However I found this game to be quite difficult from the very beginning and all the maps are locked behind either beating the previous level on a certain difficulty or a paywall.  I know people will say \u2018get good\u2019, but the game also doesn\u2019t do a good job of giving you hints on how to improve and all the bonus items are again locked behind a paywall so you can\u2019t even grind for them.  This game is a big disappointment due to the learning curve.  And if I don\u2019t want to pay for the zombies or vampires, you have to beat all the levels on the hard mode.  I cannot recommend this to anyone but the most die hard fan of this game.  I hope the develop has improved on their other titles.\n\nUpdate:  I beat all the main game plagues on Brutal difficulty and the game only allowed me to play the shadow/vampire plague once and then locked me out to buy even though it said it would open up if I beat the main plagues on that difficulty level. What is the deal.  I know people like this game but it seems like it it always blocking me from trying the next thing.",

We used to love playing this game and I still do, but I find myself using some of the copycat apps over this one fairly regularly.

It\u2019s far from user-friendly\u2014my employees found the interface confusing and frustrating to navigate, leading to constant issues with scheduling.\n\nWhen we reached out to customer service and tech support for help, the experience was equally disappointing.
